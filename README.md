### Hey there!

I'm Lo√Øc, a french developper, student at Epitech Lille.
Online I use "Sovn" as username; which is where I spend most of time.

I'm really interested in DIY Hardware, although only my keyboard and PC are custom so far.

My main project and what takes most of my free time is [Aldrnari](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari), a Skyrim Special Edition modlist made available by [Wabbajack](http://www.wabbajack.org/#/).

---

Professionally, I'm interested in learning new problem solving skills as I'm still fairly new in programming as a whole.

I'm mostly interested in all kinds of backend-related stuff, like deployment, algorithms or A.I.
