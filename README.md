### Hey there!

I'm Lo√Øc, a french developper, student at Epitech Lille.
Online I use "Sovn" as username; which is where I spend most of time.

I'm really interested in DIY Hardware, although only my keyboard and PC are custom so far.

My main project and what takes most of my free time is [Aldrnari](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari), a Skyrim Special Edition modlist made available by [Wabbajack](http://www.wabbajack.org/#/).

---

Professionally, I'm interested in learning new languages as I'm still fairly new in programming as a whole.
I'm mostly interested in deployment, sysadmin, and all kinds of backend-related stuff, like cybersec or A.I.

### Here's a few projects

 * A custom Linux workflow on Arch, using [Qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) and [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom).
- 3 Wabbajack Lists
  - [Among Sovngarde's Stars](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/AmongSovngardesStars) - Project Abandonned
  - [QWEST!](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/QWEST) - Project Abandonned
  - and my favourite; [Aldrnari](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/Aldrnari) - Project Alive
 * A few games for the terminal, written in C, using Ncurses
 * A command interpreter based on TCSH.
 * A custom keyboard using a GMMK board and Kailh Copper Speed switches.
